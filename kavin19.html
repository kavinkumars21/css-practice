                The electric vehicle (EV) revolution is speeding up, but it can only go so far without the necessary infrastructure and technology. As thinking shifts from fossil fuels to all-electric, visions of a brighter, more optimistic world come into view. The UK government’s pledge to ban the sale of all new non-electric cars, including gasoline, diesel and hybrid vehicles from 2035, highlights the drive to end the nation’s contribution to Climate Change by 2050.
                When electric cars first began to experience an influx in popularity, the sector was largely comprised of novelty vehicles, touted for their more sustainable and environmentally friendly nature. Since then, however, the EV segment has seen tremendous technological leaps that have given way to a new crop of proton-powered rides that boast multi-hundred-mile range capabilities, world-class safety standards, and some of the fastest, most capable, and are without a doubt some of the most high-performance cars currently in production.
                Though there were a handful of manufacturers that were reluctant to toss their respective hats into the EV ring, looming government mandates are forcing practically every major OEM on the plant to transition to a completely electric lineup within the next decade-and-a-half. As a result, a great many automakers have opted to get in on the action now in an effort to get a headstart in what will eventually be an all-EV market. This has ultimately resulted in the most abundant and robust electric car market in history, made up of practically every genre of automobile under the sun. To help shine a light on the finest options this sector now has to offer, we’ve compiled this definitive list of the best electric vehicles currently available on showroom floors.
